# MyReads - Udacity's React Fundamentals ND Project #1
This is my solution for the first project of the Udacity's React Fundamental Nanodegree.

## Description
The App is a virtual bookshelf that helps you to track your readings and your wanna-read books.

## Installation
The App is build in React and uses [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/), but you can find dependencies in the package.json file.
To install and run the app follow these steps:

```
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/robbisg/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git my-reads
cd my-reads

# Install dependecies
npm install

# Start the App
npm start
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000 and find your virtual bookshelf!
